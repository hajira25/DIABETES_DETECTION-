*   Click the "Submit" button to get predictions and visualizations.
*   The app will display the patient's data along with the prediction and accuracy of the model.

## Hosting 
Hosting is done using RENDER.


## Conclusion

The Diabetes Detection application leverages machine learning to provide insights into an individual's diabetes risk based on their health data. By using a Random Forest Classifier, the model can accurately predict outcomes, empowering users to make informed health decisions. This tool not only aids in early detection but also promotes awareness and proactive health management.
